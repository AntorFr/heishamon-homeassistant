# heishamon-homeassistant

An integration for heatpumps handled by [heishamon](https://github.com/Egyras/HeishaMon).
It's currently in development, expect sensors to be renamed.

## Installation
Installation should be done using https://hacs.xyz/ as a custom repository.

## Configuration

Just make sure you have an MQTT integration configured. Heishamon mqtt messages should quickly lead to auto-discovery.

## Alternatives

If you own Panasonic CZ-TAW1 module and have access to Panasonic smart cloud: use https://github.com/cjaliaga/home-assistant-aquarea or https://github.com/ronhks/panasonic-aquarea-smart-cloud-mqtt.
